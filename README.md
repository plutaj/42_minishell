🐚 Minishell

A simplified shell implementation created as part of the 42 School curriculum.
The goal of this project is to recreate basic shell behavior — handling user input, executing commands, managing environment variables, and implementing redirections and pipes — while deepening our understanding of processes, file descriptors, and signals in Unix systems.

Key features:

Command parsing and execution

Environment variable management

Input/output redirections (<, >, >>)

Pipes (|)

Built-in commands (cd, echo, pwd, export, unset, env, exit)

Signal handling (Ctrl-C, Ctrl-D, Ctrl-\)

Purpose:
Learn the fundamentals of shell behavior and process control through hands-on implementation in C.
